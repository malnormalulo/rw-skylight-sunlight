# Coding style
If you have an honest-to-goodness reason why something I'm doing is a bad idea, I'll be grateful for the feedback.
If you just think it's pointless or overly verbose, please keep that to yourself (or ask my rationale, if you're genuinely curious).
If you're simply unhappy about the fact that I'm deviating from C#/Unity conventions and borrowing conventions from other languages, please go away.
